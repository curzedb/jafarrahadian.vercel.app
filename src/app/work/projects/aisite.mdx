## Overview

AISite is a sophisticated, full-stack conversational AI platform designed to serve as an intelligent interface for an internal knowledge base. 
It's core purpose is to allow users to get fast and accurate answers from a private collection of documents (PDFs, DOCX, etc.) through an intuitive chat interaction. 
This approach prevents the AI from hallucinating or providing information from outside its designated knowledge scope.

## Core AI Technology: RAG Pipeline

The intelligence behind the chatbot is a meticulously designed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which ensures that every answer is grounded in the provided documents.

1.  **Query Transformation**: The user's raw question is first processed by a small, fast LLM (like Llama 3.2 3B) to rephrase it into an optimized search query.
2.  **Vector Retrieval**: The optimized query is used to search a FAISS vector database, retrieving the 16 most semantically similar text chunks from the knowledge base.
3.  **Relevance Gate**: To reduce noise, a hybrid filter ensures only the most relevant chunks are used. The top-scoring chunk is always included, while the rest must pass a similarity threshold to proceed.
4.  **Prompt Engineering**: The filtered, relevant text chunks are compiled into a single context block, which is then combined with the user's original question to create a final, context-rich prompt.
5.  **Answer Generation**: This final prompt is sent to the main LLM (like Llama 3.2 3B or Deepseek Qwen 1.5B), which is strictly instructed to formulate an answer based *only* on the provided context.
6.  **Streaming Response**: The generated answer is streamed back to the user word-by-word, creating a responsive and dynamic chat experience.

## Full-Stack Architecture

The application is built on a modern, decoupled architecture with three main components communicating via a REST API.

-   **Frontend**: An interactive and responsive user interface built with **Next.js, TypeScript, and Material-UI (MUI)**.
-   **Backend**: A high-performance API server built with **FastAPI (Python) and SQLAlchemy** for business logic, AI processing, and database interactions.
-   **Database**: **Microsoft SQL Server** is used for persistent data storage, including user information, chat history, and document metadata.
-   **Deployment**: The entire stack is deployed on a **Windows Server**, with processes managed by **NSSM** and unified under a single entry point using **IIS as a reverse proxy**.

## Challenges and Learnings

A primary challenge was fine-tuning the RAG pipeline to balance speed and accuracy, which involved experimenting with different chunking strategies and similarity thresholds for the relevance gate. Deploying and managing LLMs on a private Windows Server while ensuring low-latency streaming responses was a significant technical hurdle. This project provided deep, practical experience in applied RAG architecture, on-premise AI model deployment, and complex full-stack integration using modern frameworks like FastAPI and Next.js.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a secure, on-premise conversational AI tool that effectively eliminates hallucinations by grounding all responses in a verified knowledge base. It serves as an "intelligent search" engine, empowering users to find specific information through natural language conversation, drastically reducing knowledge retrieval time. The decoupled architecture provides a scalable and robust foundation, allowing for easy expansion of the knowledge base or upgrades to the underlying AI models in the future.
